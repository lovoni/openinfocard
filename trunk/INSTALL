prerequisites
 java and probably JAVA_HOME set
 ant and probably ANT_HOME set
 
 Firefox Identity Selector
 Firefox (tested with 2.0)

 Relyingparte and STS
 tomcat or jboss or...

Installation procedure
 Firefox Identity Selector

  cd ant && ant
  // currently 5 warnings

  cd ../build
  open xmldap.xpi with Firefox and restart Firefox
  navigate Firefox to https://xmldap.org/relyingparty/ to test

  If something does not work...
   Look at the Firefox javascript console!

 STS and Relyingparty
  Install your application server (AS)
  Edit server.xml to enable SSL/TLS
  Create a self-signed cert and test your AS with https.
  keytool -genkey -alias xmldap -keypass password -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password -keyalg rsa -validity 1000 -sigalg SHA1withRSA

  Please note: the default keyalg for keytool is DSA. DSA is not supported by CardSpace and not by this relyingparty.
  The default sigalg for RSA is MD5withRSA. This is not supported by CardSpace and not by this relyingparty.


  Now your application server is ready to serve https. Good.

  Move sts.properties.tmpl to sts.properties
  Move rp.properties.tmpl to rp.properties
  Edit sts.properties and rp.properties and
  - replace xmldap.org by your AS domainname and port
    e.g.: xmldap.org -> w4de3esy0069028.gdc-bln01.t-systems.com:8443
  - change the name of the keystore, alias, keystorepass and keypass
    to appropriate values for your environment
  Copy build/sts.war and build/relyingparty.war to the 
   deploy directory e.g. $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy
  Start your AS. $JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.bat (or run.sh)

  Navigate Firefox to your https://domainname:port/sts/ and 
  create a managed card.
  Navigate Firefox to your https://domainname:port/relyingparty/
   Click "New Card", choose "managed card" and import the created card.

  Now everything should work. Add a comment at http://xmldap.blogspot.com/
   how cool this all is.


  If something does not work...


  Look at the AS logs!
   If its something with "keystore not found" or the like, then check
   rp-web.xml and sts-web.xml

   If the AS complains about "/Users/cmort/..." not found, then check
   rp-web.xml and sts-web.xml again. If these are clean, edit ServletUtil.java
   and insert your keystore, password etc. Sorry. Somebody should fix this...

- Axel Nennker

If you are using SUN One Application Server... 
Configure it to use JKS as the keystore type. 
DO NOT USE NSS!!! You can not access the private key with NSS api, but
you need it to decrypt the xmlToken.
Repeat: DO NOT USE NSS!!!
Gather some friends to chant it for added fun.
