INSTALL

Assumptions: 
 Access Manager and AppServer are installed and running
 The AppServer must support SSL
 (currently the SUN ONE server must run as root when AM is used)

1) Edit Makefile to adapt to your environment
1a) # http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6773-10/amadmin.html
    # read "Loading the Login Module Sample into Access Manager"
    # http://docs-pdf.sun.com/817-7649/817-7649.pdf
    # <AMADMIN> --runasdn uid=amAdmin,ou=People,<root_suffix> \
    #  --password <password> --data amadmin.xml
    # root_suffix can be found in /etc/opt/SUNWam/config/AMConfig.properties
    # com.iplanet.am.rootsuffix=dc=e1,dc=i3alab,dc=net
    #
   /opt/SUNWam/bin/amadmin --runasdn uid=amAdmin,ou=People,dc=e1,dc=i3alab,dc=net --password password --data amadmin.xml
2) make && make deploy
3) redeploy amserver
4) stop && start websrvr
5) test: notice the httpS. InfoCard login does not work without SSL
   https://n1v1.e1.i3alab.net/amserver/UI/Login?module=LoginInfoCard
   - This first authentication fails because you have to administer user
     Add a user with uid=<emailaddress> and 
     password=<password from LoginInfoCard.java> in the AM's user database
   - The default password is "password". Change it! 
     Remember: This is only a demo. NO WARRANTY!
6) Modify the success page and the layout
