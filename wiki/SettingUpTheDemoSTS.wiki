#summary How to setup your local system and install the STS webapp

= Setting up the environment =
Let's assume you have a web application server with a 1.5 runtime (i.e. Tomcat 5.5.x). For this article, let's assume you have Tomcat isntalled at _/usr/local/apache-tomcat-5.5.20_ 
==Keystore Setup== 
 # Choose a path and location for the keystore: ( _i.e. /opt/myXmldapInfocardKeystore.jks_ )
 # generate a key using _keytool_ : ` keytool -genkey -keyalg rsa -alias mytestKey -keystore /opt/myXmldapInfocardKeystore.jks`
  # Enter a password: (Assuming you have not already created this keystore, choose a password for the keystore)
  # Enter a first and last name (CN): (This can be any arbitrary name, though it will be displayed as the CN of the signing cert's subject DN)
  # Enter an organizational unit (OU): (Again ,this can be any arbitrary name, though it will be displayed as the OU part of the signing cert's subject DN)
  # Enter an organization name (O): (Again ,this can be any arbitrary name, though it will be displayed as the O part of the signing cert's subject DN)
  # Enter a city (L): (Again ,this can be any arbitrary name, though it will be dispalyed as the L (for "Locality") part of the signing cert's subject DN)
  # Enter a state name or abbreviation (ST): (Again ,this can be any arbitrary string, though it will be displayed as the ST part of the signing cert's subject DN)
  # Enter a country code (C): (Again ,this can be any arbitrary 2-letter string, though it will be displayed as the C part of the signing cert's subject DN)
  # _keytool_ will display the DN you have created for this key: (it should look something like: _CN=My Application, OU=Engineering, O=XMLDAP, L=San Francisco, ST=CA, C=US_ )
  # Enter a password for <mytestKey>: (enter as password for the newly created key)
  # OK, now there should be a file at /opt/myXmldapInfocardKeystore.jks This is the Java keystore containing the key (mytestKey) that we created in the preceding steps

==Building and configuring the STS WAR file==
 # Check out the code from SVN:
  * `svn checkout http://openinfocard.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ openinfocard`
 # Edit STS properties file
  * set _keystore_ to the value you chose in step 1 (i.e.  _/opt/myXmldapInfocardKeystore.jks_ )
