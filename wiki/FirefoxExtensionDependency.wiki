~~strike~~The openinfocard id selector currently needs Kevin Miller's id selector selector extension.

Removed this dependency. Thanks to Rob Richards for his help.


= Details =

First versions of the openinfocard id selector were self contained.

After installation the id selector was triggered when Firefox detected an object of the type  application/x-informationcard. ~~strike~~This is no longer the case. Currently you need to install Kevin's extension and the openinfocard id selector extension.~~strike~~
